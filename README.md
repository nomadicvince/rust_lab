# Rust Practice

**Sharpen your Rust skills through hands-on projects in Systems Programming, Artificial Intelligence, and WebAssembly.**

---

## Overview

This repository is a curated Rust development lab designed to support continuous learning and experimentation. It includes standalone modules and projects that explore core and advanced topics in:

- **Systems Programming** – low-level memory management, multithreading, OS interaction
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** – model serving, numerical computing, and ML integration
- **WebAssembly (Wasm)** – compile-to-web workflows, UI interactivity, and embedded logic

Each folder is scoped to a specific concept or domain to encourage modular exploration.
